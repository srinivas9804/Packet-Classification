Expected outputs for each ruleset:

A list of distinct rules after the removal of duplication
- rule ID (start the numbering from 1, smaller rule ID = higher priority)
- original values of the 5 fields 

PIC Encoding results
- number of distinct prefixes/ranges/values of the 5 fields
- lengths of the PIC codes of the 5 fields
- overall length of the encoded rule
- PIC tables for the 5 fields
   ~ original value : PIC codeword

A list of encoded rules and mapping results
- rule ID 
- encoded rule (data-vector and mask-vector, printed in hex digits format)
- priority code
- mapping result of each rule
   ~ match unit ID = 0 (if SA/DA code <= 6 bits, SP and DP = *)
   ~ regular match unit ID (ID > 0), location, offset (left or right entry) 

Contents of Regular match units
- No. of regular match units

- contents of the match unit 
- match unit ID
- type (1-level bit-selection or 2-level bit-selection)
- selected bits
   ~ 1-level bit-selection : 1 bit-vector (right aligned) to represent the selected bits (printed in hex digits)
   ~ 2-level bit-selection : 1 bit-vector (or indexes of the 2 selected bits) for the level-1
                                        4 bit-vectors for the 4 partitions (level-2)
- number of rules mapped to the match unit
- Table showing the contents of the memory array:
   ~ address : entry 1, entry 2 (An entry may contain 1 rule, a pair of rules, or is empty.)
                      Show an entry in the form {r1}, or {r1, r2}, or {empty}
